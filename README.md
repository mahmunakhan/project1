# Deep-Learning-Car-Brand
<br>
In this project we are using a A pre-trained ResNet50 model from Keras applications used for transfer learning on our own data set .
futher we save the model weights that are trained on our dataset.
Load the model through our designed Flask web application that classifies images of cars into different categories (e.g., Audi, Lamborghini, Mercedes) using a pre-trained Keras model.
